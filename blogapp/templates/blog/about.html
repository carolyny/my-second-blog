                    <p>  Hello, I'm Carolyn.  In May 2015, I took part in a <a href= "https://djangogirls.org/">Django Girls</a> workshop.  I was amazed at what I managed to complete in one day and how much I enjoyed coding.   This website is the second version of the blog I created on that day.  <br> </br>I aim to write about my "learning to code" journey.  It's started slowly but I want to change career, so I need to learn, to practise, to write code and regularly <strong> push code. </strong>  So introduction over, time to get properly started.</p>
